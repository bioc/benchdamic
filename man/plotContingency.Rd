\usage{
plotContingency(enrichment, method, levels_to_plot)
}
\arguments{
\item{enrichment}{enrichment object produced by \link{createEnrichment}
function.}

\item{method}{name of the method to plot.}

\item{levels_to_plot}{A character vector containing the levels of the
enrichment variable to plot.}
}
\value{
a \code{ggplot2} object.
}
\description{
Plot of the contingency tables for the chosen method. The
top-left cells are colored, according to Fisher exact tests' p-values, if the
number of features in those cells are enriched.
